## About Paramaterial

Paramaterial is a collection of tools for post-processing mechanical test data to extract material properties. 

The library currently has examples for processing uniaxial tensile and compression test data, as well as plane-strain tension and compression test data. It is versatile and can be adapted for use with data from other tests.

The examples provide a guide for processing and analyzing test data in a way that will conserve high data quality. This is achieved by following practices for ensuring repeatability and transparency of measurements and data transformation.
