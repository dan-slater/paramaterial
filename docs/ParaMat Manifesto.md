# ParaMat Manifesto

Paramat is an open-source software for automated post-processing of material characterisation test data. The package allows users with minimal knowledge of Python to leverage the language's strong file-handling and data processing capabilities. The software is intended to be as extensible as possible, and has been designed with ease-of-modification, as well as ease-of-use in mind.
