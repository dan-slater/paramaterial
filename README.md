# Paramaterial
Post-processing toolkit for mechanical testing data. 

* **Source Code**: [https://github.com/dan-slater/paramaterial](https://github.com/dan-slater/paramaterial)

* **Documentation**: [https://dan-slater.github.io/paramaterial/](https://dan-slater.github.io/paramaterial/)

Use Paramaterial to:
- Process large datasets of test measurements to automatically identify material parameters and fit consitutive models.
- Produce publication-quality plots and test reports to document raw data, processed data and analysis.
- Improve efficiency and traceability of processing to increase data quality.

## Installation

> **Note**: Paramaterial is currently in alpha development. The API is subject to change.

## Usage

Usage of the toolkit is demonstrated in the [examples](

The key features are:

* **Versatile**: The code design is sufficiently general so that it should work for a wide range of material tests.
* **Easy-to-use**

Also handle data in bulk useful. Improve efficiency, traceability and repeatability.

Automated generation of test reports.

* **Transparent**: Using open-source code with version markers for post-processing of test measurements provides transparency.
* **Sensible Defaults**: The API is designed around sensible defaults for things like modulus strain range, whether to expect a yield strength etc.
* **Automatic Calculations**: pymechtest will automatically calculate strength, elastic modulus, yield strength etc. for you.
* **Elegant Looking Stress Strain Curves**: pymechtest uses [altair] to plot amazing looking stress strain curves.
* **Reliable**: pymechtest uses battle-tested libraries like [pandas], [numpy] and [altair] to do most of the work. The API is really a domain-specific convenience wrapper. pymechtest also maintains high test coverage.




## Installation
