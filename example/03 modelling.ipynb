    "\"Starting from a preload (which was chosen to be 30 lbf to minimize errors in the strain measurements caused by factors such as initial grip alignment), the upper proportional limit (UPL) is determined by linear regression as the point that minimizes the residuals of the slope fit between that point and the preload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, starting from this UPL, the procedure was repeated in the opposite direction to obtain the lower proportional limit (LPL).\n",

    "This procedure is automated and the proportional limits are consistently identified for all stress-strain curves using this criteria.\n",
